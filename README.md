# weather

In this proejct I created a weather app that can be used on a webpage, tablet, or mobile device.

For this project I used Bulma in the HTML, which prevented the need to use any CSS. There were some issues with styling that I would have liked to have changed, but I could not figure out how to change them to what I wanted. I want to continue working with Bulma and hope to become better at using it.

I added a button on the left side of the navbar that, when clicked, will redirect the user to my portfolio.

For the JavaScript I got help from tutors and during office hours, I think I have a better understanding of JavaScript now.
